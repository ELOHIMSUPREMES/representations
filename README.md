# Representations

This library was made to have a way to represent our objects without violating encapsulation, which happens when using getters, but avoiding making the object responsible of handling multiple data formats.
It is based on the [*printers* pattern by Yegor Bugayenko](http://www.yegor256.com/2016/04/05/printers-instead-of-getters.html).

More documentation and code soon...
